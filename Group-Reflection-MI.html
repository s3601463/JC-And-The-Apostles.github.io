	Throughout the assignment and working with the group, I've felt that the group has worked fairly well together, having 6 group members has meant that most members have only had small parts of work to do in order for all of the assigned tasks to be completed on time and to be completed well. I feel that the group has really meshed well, we were all quite friendly quite quickly, and I feel this benefited the feel of the group. However, due to this friendliness, I feel that in class time we could often be distracted and waste some of our time, however it was not always a complete waste of time, mostly it lead to things that were not required but would add flair to our group project. I was surprised by the individual abilities that some of our group members had, like Jared's abilities of creating websites. I learned that it would probably have been good to have someone who was a little more serious in the group who could direct discussion, but honestly we've been an alright group.
