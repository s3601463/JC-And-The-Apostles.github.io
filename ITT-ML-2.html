	<p class="bodyText">
	Machine Learning is already having massive impacts on the world, with large amounts of what we see on the internet decided upon by bots that are created through Machine Learning. However, large swathes of jobs could possibly be affected by the advent and renaissance of Machine Learning, as more powerful computers would be able to interpret more data, meaning that live video could be accurately understood in real time meaning that face tracking and recognition will only become easier and more common, autonomous vehicles will become more and more prevalent as time goes on. Machine Learning is also tied to the rise of automation, and a worrying amount of jobs are able to be automated, from discovery and pattern recognition in a law firm, to taxi, truck and delivery driving, simple cooking as seen in a fast food or cheap cafe type restaurants, music creation, diagnosing and treating diseases, and many, many simple jobs that make up the backbone of economies. And due to the price of electricity vs the cost of human labour, corporations will be chomping at the bit to replace brain based learning with machine learning. Machine Learning is going to affect large parts of the globabl population, possibly changing the world as we know it, for better and worse, making goods and services much cheaper than ever though possible, but also meaning that the economies and labour markets will need to adapt and change in ways that we don't have ideas for at the current time.
