	Judging by the overall results of test 1 (Myers-Briggs Style) all members of the group are more introverts than extroverts which is likely to mean that there won’t be too much talking and chatting happening throughout the making of the assignment. Most members are anticipated to work on their part individually without disturbing others, however that might not be the case with each member as some collaboration is still expected. Also, some bigger parts most probably will need multiple people working on it. In the second test (Learning Style) our team managed to score all three types of learner style. This will be crucial to the groups well-oiled performance as information collection and analysis will no doubt require different approaches in order to fully understand it. There is also a slight skew towards tactile learner in overall teams results which won’t hurt because IT as a field requires loads of hand-on experience for it to become more intuitive to the person.<br><br>
	Test 3 (Big Five Style) makes Conscientiousness and Neuroticism stand out in our groups case. Having high conscientiousness gives our team hope to have well organised, self-disciplined and dependable process for making of this assignment. Neuroticism on the other hand hints towards possible emotional difficulties that our team members will encounter throughout the assignment however as a team as a whole, we do not feel intimidated by the high percentile because it could be caused by all of us being more antisocial than an average human being.
