	Michael Vella s3766753:<br>
	Michael was born and raised in Australia however most of his ancestry comes from the small island nation of Malta. During school years he attended rather underwhelming catholic primary and catholic high schools or so his experience shows. On the side Michael has learned to speak some Italian and loves to take his “shitty Japanese sports car” for a spin and some photos. Michaels passion for IT grew since the childhood as he discovered games and interesting tech to dig in, but the final breakthrough happened once he took a Python course at university.<br><br>
	Jin Han Yap s3543058: <br>
	Jin moved to Australia in 2001 from Malaysia where he was born to Chinese parents. His first language is English, but he is also able to understand most of Cantonese and speak it a little too. In his free time Jin enjoys playing snooker and computer games with his friends. They even have put together a friendly team. Over last couple years he has been studying an Associate Degree in Engineering, specialising in networking which also has brought him to currently studying IT as part of his degree. <br><br>
	Fjodor Zadonski s3572982:<br>
	Fjodor comes from Estonian city called Tallinn. Although he is Estonian citizen Fjodor has mostly Russian and eastern European background. He speaks both Estonian and Russian with English being his third language. When it comes to hobbies, he likes to spend time playing team sports such as basketball or soccer, but gaming does not come last either. Since getting his first personal laptop Fjodor has developed more and more interest towards IT as he understood the vast potential of the industry and the possibilities in it. Being a Business major, he chose to study two IT electives in his last semester in order to broaden his capabilities in using IT programs and equipment.
