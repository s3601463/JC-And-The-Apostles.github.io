	<h4 class="SubHeadText">What is the likely impact?</h4>
	<p class="bodyText">
	There are many impact which can face the development of driverless(autonomous vehicles) , some of the most glaring issues are around safety and faults. For according to <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/how-self-driving-cars-work">“https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/how-self-driving-cars-work”</a> , more than 30,000 vehicle deaths occurred in 2015; with the implementation driverless cars thanks to error prevention, this number could essentially reduce down to zero, the ultimate goal of most countries, most notably Australia, with the Zero Lives campaign, regarding road deaths. Another impact which would benefit the development of self-driving, would allowing those who unable to drive anywhere given the ability to be more reliant on themselves rather than a carer. If level 5 autonomy was introduced there would be a lot of older people going outside and place more often allowing for the final years of their life not being forced to be in a nursing home and having people drive them places. Lastly the most notable impact on the self-driving vehicles is towards the environment. Since self-vehicles are electric, they produce zero emission, allowing for less overall global warming. Especially here in Australia, we are one of the leading producers of carbon emissions, having the ability to switch to zero emission alternate would have immediate effects on the environment especially the ozone layer which due to our emissions has caused a small hole to form. With the ability to change, the development of autonomous vehicles is a step in the right direction for the environment and for everyone.
