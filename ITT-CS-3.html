	1. Voting systems. Voting for a party or a person in a position of power can be done via a computer or digitally uploaded. When a user places a vote that voters ID gets hashed, and then that data gets stored as completed. The vote choice has an allocated number and is stored encrypted and sent to the server. When the votes are called to view, they are decrypted and then display their values to their respective party/person. <br>
	2. Bitcoin. Bitcoin transaction are completed via blockchain system, transactions are private to the outside however hashing is used to validate the process and complete the transactions. <br>
	3. Steganography. Sometimes hiding data in plain sight is the best course of action. People may hide data in sounds, images, videos and, messages. A real-world example of this can be seen in the Cicada 3301 puzzles which have used different variants of steganography. The most notable one can be the song "The Instar Emergence‚Äù. This sound file lead to another clue however, Majority of the Cicada 3301 puzzles consisted of steganography. It is hard to say what the future holds for cybersecurity as each year different types of threats and, countermeasures are developed. However, one definite is the evolution and implementation of quantum cryptography. The theory of quantum cryptography has been around since the mid nineteen seventies. With the future we can expect that quantum computers will become a normal sight and security will need to evolve as such.
