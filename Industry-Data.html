	Our Group, when it comes to their ideal jobs vary, two of us what to becoming I.T Managers whilst the rest of us want to become a telecommunications field engineer, senior data scientist, software engineer and Security Analyst. When it comes to ranking these in terms of demand from employers, I was unable to find the demand for telecommunications field engineers, or senior data scientist using the burning glass data however, when looking at the other three ideal jobs, as you can see from the below table, there was a clear demand for software engineers from the most recent set of data recorded, whilst surprisingly, IT managers were low in demand. I was unable to find any accurate data on the demand of either of the two remaining however both are expected to increase by over 20% in the next coming years. <br><br>
