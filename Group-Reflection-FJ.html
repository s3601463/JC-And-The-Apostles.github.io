	I was last to join the group of Jesus Christ and the Apostles and thus missed out on some of the work division and general project discussion that was so very needed for in time management of workload. Luckily guys in my group were all very organised and Joshua nicely explained to me the part I needed to do in order to be a legitimate contributor. Everyone in the team is friendly and well-mannered however some miscommunication did still occur which lead to some last-minute work and re-designing of the assignment. On my part I could’ve been more proactive in the lesson time by asking questions which would have helped me in starting to write my part earlier and thus caused less stress to the team. Lastly, I want to mention the outstanding effort from Joshua, Jared and Michael in organising the team and its workload, especially Jared for also creating the website which no one in our team could’ve done better.
