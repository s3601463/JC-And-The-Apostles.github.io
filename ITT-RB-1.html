	In our current day of technological advances, we are looking into robots being a new alternative to a human driven society. Many researchers are ultimately trying to achieve a humanoid robot, these robots are aimed to be capable to achieve tasks comparable or more precise to an actual human being. To make a functioning humanoid robot, researchers will need a solution to incorporate multiple different aspects and characteristics of a human, to make the robot able to function similarly to a real human being in the same situation. Some of these features that might be necessarily involved but are not limited to creating a successful humanoid robot include; advanced locomotion and manipulation, artificial intelligence, learning and cognitive development, machine vision, biomechanics and behavioural studies to name a few. <br><br>
	With the current progress made so far in the robotic development, we have made huge progress into developing and achieving the goals set for creating a versatile robot that can handle any movement and can manipulate objects in a specific manner. This has been shown through the creations made by Boston Dynamics, an American engineering and robotics design company. They have made huge progress towards creating robots that can functionally replace humans in specific tasks and achieve them to a higher productivity level and precision. Some of their designs include robots that are able to pick up and move objects such as boxes in a logistic production facility which could help to replace humans in a large section of our current job industry. They have also created numerous multiple legged robots able to traverse harsh terrains easily and safely. But their biggest contributions to the advancement of humanoid robotics would have to be their ‘Atlas’ design. This specific robot has similar physical features as a human being, and is very agile, the robot has a great sense of balance and is able to traverse elevated platforms, being able to jump on and off of them and even being able to do a backflip and landing on two feet. The progress shown through this innovation shows us that we are able to create a robot that is able to easily mimic human movement to an advanced level.
