	Another large factor in creating a human like robot, would be the cognitive processing power required to be able to think like a normal human being. The ability to adapt in certain situations and to create the best alternative action to react to that situation is something that is needed to be integrated into the cognitive processing of the robot. Currently we have made steps into allowing the robot to partially cognitively recognise objects, allowing a robot to function and excel in a specific task, such as drawing and organising different objects. A good example of this would be OpenAI, a non-profit research company backed by Elon Musk and numerous other entrepreneurs. This company as put out software that allows a robot / program to learn through a trial and error software. The software allows the test subject to continuously run through a task repeatedly, slowly improving at the task after each attempt. This has been shown to be a working system, as it has pulled off such feats as, beating video game pros at their own game, and also allowing a robotic system to manipulate an object with human like dexterity. <br><br>
	The advances in creating robots such as the ‘Atlas’ and software such as ‘OpenAI’ could help to make the dream of creating a humanoid robot one step closer.
