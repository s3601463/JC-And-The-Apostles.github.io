	The principles of cybersecurity are there for the protection of privacy and data against threats that can either expose the user or the system that the user is using. It consists of a large variety of disciplines. We mainly see cybersecurity, in our homes, with anti-virus, firewalls, passwords and VPNs. Anti-virus software is designed to protect users from malicious software which can be obtained accessing shady websites or by downloading files from untrustworthy sources. Firewalls are another form of prevention from outside threats to users. Firewalls will filter and flag incoming traffic from the outside network and determine whether it can enter or not. Password are one of the most important aspects of privacy and security. This is both the front line and final line of defence against your data being at risk. When a password is created it is then hashed and stored in the system. Hashing is an irreversible process which converts a string to a fixed length, dependant on the algorithm chosen. When the user inputs the password, the system will hash the password and compare it to the stored hash. If they match the system will allow entry, if not depending on how the system is set will either give multiple tries or lock them out of the system. VPNs, virtual private networks, are programs that create a secure connection over public networks. They are safe and allow for data travelling between a point, i.e. a website, and the user to be encrypted. If traffic is intercepted the data will appear like gibberish keeping the data safe.
