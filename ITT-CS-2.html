	Some state-of-the-art technology in cybersecurity is Blockchains and, SHA-2 hashing, and cloud-based cryptography. Blockchain is a distributed decentralised public ledger that records transactions digitally. The “block” aspect of the blockchain consists of information related to the individual transaction, i.e. date/time/dollar amount. These transactions are then digitally signed, and then hashed with a unique Identity. This allows for the transaction to be identified from others. According to Investopedia a single block can store up to 1MB of data. “Depending on the size of the transactions, that means a single block can house a few thousand transactions under one roof.”(Investopedia, 2019). The chain refers to the fact that individual transactions are linked together, the transaction is linked to the previous respective transaction. A large number of computers are utilised in blockchains to validate and monitor transactions and information. These computers create a peer-to-peer network. Cloud based storage is an IT technology that has recently emerged. One security concern when dealing with storing data on the could is the decryption of the data. Homomorphic encryption is one way and is currently one that is used in encryption and decryption of data in cloudbased storage. Fully homomorphic encryption has been an issue since 1978. A solution was unclear for a large amount of time, however within the last two decades multiple solutions have been found and implemented. These implemented solutions were in development within the last decade. Secure hashing algorithms, SHA, have been around since 1992 starting with SHA-0. Overtime researchers have created algorithms that are more secure and harder to crack. The most recent version of algorithms used is SHA-3 which was released in 2015. As discussed early, hashing algorithms are a one-way function. Unfortunately, with SHA-3, according to (Grimes, 2019), majority of “the world’s software and hardware (didn’t) support it”. Hardware is becoming the main for handling cryptographic routines and that is where SHA-3 shines. SHA-3 has a greater speed on hardware compared to both SHA-2 and SHA-1. However, SHA-3 is slower than both in software. Here are three examples of current uses of cybersecurity.<br><br>
