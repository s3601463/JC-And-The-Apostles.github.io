	The secondary feature would be the building of the pc. Once the customer buys the computer, the build list is sent to the build station off site. Here employees would receive the part list and build the system based on when the customer wants it by. If they pay extra for same day building their custom pc build would be prioritized compared to those who didnâ€™t pay for same day build. In addition to the service, the customer can use the specially generated build code which allows them to track the progress of their build, down to the component. Eg. There would be a button the builder would press based on what component they would be inserting into the case. This would allow the consumer to know what point the builder is up to and gives an estimation of when the computer will be able to be picked up.<br><br>
	For the youth market or people on the go, the mobile/web-based service provides the same outcome but with a user-friendly UI. It has the same functionality with the yes or no question chatbot, but it saves the user having to go into the store to purchase the computer. The service will also have a home deliver component so that from the comfort of your home you can order. The consumer is guaranteed a pc system built to their needs.<br><br>
	This chatbot/service can be implemented into any brick and mortar store; Ie. JBHIFI, Harvey Norman, The Good Guys. Where people can trust what they are getting is right for them.

	<h4 class="SubHeadText">Tools and Technology</h4>
	<p class="bodyText">The main tools and technology needed for this project to work would be chatbot booth setup up in a way which is simple, clean and user friendly. In terms of the language the chatbot is running, it would be running Python, as it is able to make more AI decisions based on the responses given with the help of the implementation of OpenAI. For the pc building side of things, the need for a clean and static free workplace, with all tools need for putting together a pc and static resistant wrist straps. In addition, the app and web-based platforms will both use the Python program through a web-based service, as the app will essentially run the website shaped for the phone in use.</p>
