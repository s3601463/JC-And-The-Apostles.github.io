	Self-driving vehicle(also known as Autonomous vehicles) are cars or truck in which a computer takes control and solely operates the car/truck. This means that there is no need for any human input into the driving mechanics of the car. How they do this is, the manufacturers combine the development of sensors and software to navigate lanes and drive the vehicle. Currently, on the road there are no fully autonomous vehicles operating in Australia. Now, there are many vehicles which have semi-autonomous driving capabilities. One more recognised name is Tesla, they are one of the leading manufactures of self-driving cars. All their cars are fitted with many sensors and cameras which allow the vehicles to change lands and maintain speed and lane on its own, however they cannot do fully self-drive. In the world of driverless cars there are many Levels of Autonomy, it ranges from level zero to level five. Level zero is where all controllable systems in a vehicle are handled by a person. This excludes a system like ABS which is controlled on the cars behalf. Level 1 is where most modern-day cars have automated systems like autobraking and cruise control however, these systems can only work one at a time for level 1 autonomy. For level 2 autonomy the vehicle can control two systems at once, this can be lane keeping and acceleration, some more advanced cars have this. Most notably base level Tesla’s would have level 2 autonomy. Level 3 is where things get interesting, this level allows for the vehicle to take over all critical to safety systems including accelerating and lane movement. However, the vehicle will alert the driver when if necessary, to take over control in the situation. A prime example of this is for the Tesla’s autopilot, for it to work for a long period of time it requires intermittent contact with the wheel so that the car knows if the person is one awake, and two can take control. Some other manufacturers use eye tracking to determine if the driver is keeping their eye on the road, and if not would alert them to keep an eye on the surroundings and to stay alert. Level 4 is where companies like Google, Tesla, Amazon strive to accomplish. Level 4 autonomy where the vehicle is fully-autonomous in most situations. This means that the car/truck can perform critical to safety driving mauvers, ie driving straight, lane keeping and monitoring the surrounding environment. Though currently no company has yet to manufacture level 4 vehicles but in the next 5 years, companies like Nikon who have invested in LIDAR sensors hope that more and more companies including start-ups are able to keep up with demand for level 4 autonomy. Level 5 autonomy is the highest and most difficult level to accomplish as it requires the vehicle to drive in any and all situations, like off road and in harsh weather conditions. The main elements which make this feasible are the constant developments and alteration in both the sensory components of the self-driving model, ie LIDAR sensors, cameras, image processing. Also, in the hardware side of autonomy, with have a centralised computing system which combines the image recognition and sensory data and the physical triggering of brakes, the change of the steering wheel all which contribute to the level of autonomy the vehicle has.
