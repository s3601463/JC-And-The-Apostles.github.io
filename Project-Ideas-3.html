	<p class="bodyText">
	The main skill required would be a group of software engineers who can code a chatbot to respond to simple yes and no answers also be able to put together a system build based on those answers. For the building side of the service, the employees should have extensive knowledge in system building should any problem with the build arise. In terms of finding people for the job, it shouldn’t be too difficult as the IT industry is ever growing and the need for IT trained people is increasing, so finding people right for the job shouldn’t be too hard.
	</p>
	<h4 class="SubHeadText">Outcome</h4>
	<p class="bodyText">
	The main outcome of this project is that the original problem with people not knowing where to go to find information and help in building a system, are able to use a simple chatbot interface to determine what kind of PC they need. This would open a service which anyone can use to find a PC right for them.</p>
