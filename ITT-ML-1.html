	Machine learning is the way in which computers are taught how to do things that might not necessarily have been thought of as something that a computer can normally do, like drive a car, identify a person, or write music and create art. There are many ways that machine learning can be implemented, but the gist of it is that a computer is given a set of inputs or variables, is given a way to interpret these variables, outputs its decision and is given feedback from these decisions. For example, if a computer is given the task of driving a car, the variables could be as follows: Speed of the Road, Speed of the Car, Curvature of the Road, Closest Obstacle, Distance to Centre of Lane, Signs on the Road. <br><br>
	Machine Learning would then start off with a basic algorithm that tries it's best to interpret the inputs that it is given and tries to make the best decision that it can. It might fail, but the algorithm is tweaked, and variable weights can be changed until an algorithm that can function is created. As long as a task can be broken down into a set of goals and inputs, Machine Learning can more than likely slowly create an algorithm to do the job autonomously. Currently, machine learning is used for a myriad of internet tasks, like YouTube's algorithm to suggest a video to you, based on what you have previously watched, what other people similar to you watch, and using data to ensure that you will watch YouTube for as long as possible. This has caused controversy when YouTube served suggested videos to children that were wildly inappropriate for children, but contained words that a child might look for. Youtube didn't catch this immediately as the algorithm is written and implemented by a machine, and not written by a real programmer. YouTube's ads are also based on machine learning, trying to match ads to you based on what you've watched, how old it guesses you are, your interests, search and cookie data stored on your web browser, as well as trying to balance the most amount of ads to make the maximum money, while keeping you watching YouTube for as long as possible. In the future, as simple, basic, non-specific robots become more and more prominent, machine learning will become very important, as the tasks that it is able to do will depend on what it will be able to be taught, and that will depend on what Machine Learning has progressed to at that current state. Machine learning will also become faster and faster as computing only becomes faster and faster, as the speed at which the algorithms can be tweaked is largely dependent upon the speed at which a computer can evaluate the set of algorithms that is has in front of it. The other would be the quality and ubiquity of sensors for a certain application, as well as the ability for a person to have the ability to break down a task that no-one had thought of before into the task-variable-goal system that Machine Learning relies upon in order to be able to function.
