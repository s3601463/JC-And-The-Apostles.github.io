	From completing the assignment with this particular group of people i found that the majority of people have contributed their part to the overall project. I feel like when completing this project we majorly lacked communication. Most of the members included myself just assigned ourselves specific parts of the assignment to complete, we didn't have a lot of feedback and cooperation as compared to normal. I found it surprising as a group, it felt like we were all individuals working on a part of a bigger collaboration. The thing I learnt from this project, is if a group is made from random people, it is harder to communicate with the other members, so some sort of ice breaking method/scenarios would help us students to communicate more effectively. I felt that the Github activity log, accurately presents the effectiveness of each student whilst creating the assignment. It shows which student has contributed to which part of the assignment, but lacks the detail in what was actual written by each student.
