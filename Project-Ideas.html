	<h4 class="SubHeadText">The Project</h4>
	<p class="bodyText">
	The group idea for an IT project would be a chatbot which is used on many platforms; Android/IOS, web-based and a physical medium. This chatbot is designed to create a complete PC system build for a customer by asking relevant and intuitive questions regarding what their main uses for the computer would be and sifting through selected answers to the prescribed questions and creating a complete PC build for the customer’s need. The physical, mobile, and web-based chatbots would all be the same, but target a separate audience, for the youth market, it would be the app based, but for those who don’t have a phone or struggle using a computer/web-based platform, would try the physical instore chatbot.</p>
	<h4 class="SubHeadText">What is the service?</h4>
	<p class="bodyText">
	The main features of the service are supported on how the chatbot works. For instore consumers; if a customer comes into a brick and mortar store ie; Harvey Norman, they are greeted with a simple touchscreen-based booth. The premise of the booth would allow customers to come in and physically answer the questions on screen and if they need to have help, an employee who knowledgeable regarding the system, can assist if there is any problem. <br><br>
	The main style of how the chat bot works is it will ask very simple yes or no question. This will allow for any one customer, no matter the age difference, to be able to understand the questions and answer based on their need so that they can get a pc personalised for them. These questions would include; Are you a gamer, are you a graphic designer or video producer. If the answer was no, it would eliminate all graphics cards from the end system, saving consumers money. For those who are elderly it would ask them what kind of size of the pc system they would want it. This would eliminate all large ATX motherboards in preference of mATX motherboards and thus larger cases. The chatbot would also ask if they store a lot of movies/tv shows/ photos. If they do, they would prioritize larger HDD, and maybe add a SSD if necessary. At the end there would be a printout of the built system specs and price. The customer then would have the option to purchase and get it built that day for a premium price.</p>
