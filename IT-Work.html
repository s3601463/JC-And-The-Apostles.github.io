	Interviewee: William Lim <br>
	Current Head Tutor of UCD( User Centered Design) <br><br>
	1. Which field of IT did you specialise in, and what type of roles or work did you undertake while in this particular field?<br>
	I specialise in User Experience, though I have done work as a software engineer. In this role I manage user research work and ensure that the user requirements are accurate based on data collected. I also provide input into designs for projects.<br><br>
	2. What type of people did you often meet whilst working? Did this	include clients, investors, etc?<br>
	A huge variety actually. I work with clients, programmers, devops, designers, visual artists, marketing managers, product managers.<br><br>
	3. When working, where did you find you spent most of your time working? eg. office or home<br>
	It depends from project to project. I work at home, at the office, client side, in cafes or even museums. I also go where i need to find users.<br><br>
	4. What aspect of your position did you find the most challenging and how did you try and overcome these obstacles?<br>
	The biggest challenge is educating clients and developers about the benefits and processes involved in UX. It is important to get them on board rather than to be antagonistic about it. I would say the human aspect is a lot more challenging than the technical.
