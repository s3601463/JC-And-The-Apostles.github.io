	<p class="bodyText">
	In cybersecurity there are two types of developments. One side is attacking, and the other side is protection. The development tends to depend on which side is the first to progress. The potential impacts also depend on the course of events. In the event that the attacking force is what is most dominant, a large number of privacy breaches can be expected. It could affect individual data, such as bank details or login details to important files, and co-operate / government data, which could result in certain data becoming available for sale or to the public which could cause anarchy. If protection develops first than systems and sensitive data will be protected without hassle for a decent amount of time. The first to be affected by developed quantum cryptography will be military. This is seen throughout history as technology that we use now was used in the past many years before public release. These groups are the first to benefit and it will allow them to better protect their respective country easier from external threats allowing them to monitor their networks and other networks as well. When cryptography and cybersecurity begin to migrate to quantum computers the old systems will become redundant and we would have no need to use such technology. We will also see extreme fluctuations in security as hackers and security groups will be working around the clock to try and prevent or best new systems.
