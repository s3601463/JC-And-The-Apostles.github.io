	The effects of Machine Learning are very hard to gauge, if something like the Sesame Credit in China was tied to an automated system to test and check who was loyal to the current ruling party, then life in that country would be absolutely horrible. However this could also make many services and products much cheaper and more accessible, like a doctor's visit being able to be done at home reliably and quickly, taxi driving and internet deliveries being done cheaper and more efficiently than ever thought possible. This is a double-edged sword, as Machine Learning would mean that one-on-one teaching would finally be possible, however teachers of the world would either have their jobs radically changed, or removed entirely from the workforce. This could also affect how families share news, such as the way that Facebook chooses what to show you, if it decides that your distant family members announcement isn't worth showing you, then you won't see it, and if a breaking news story that is relevant to you but is unlikely to be clicked is compared to a false, irrelevant story that is much more likely to be clicked, the news that you see and the worldview that you have can be wildly altered and changed, all in the way that an algorithm decides what to show you. The effects of Machine Learning could be absolutely massive, both for better or worse.
