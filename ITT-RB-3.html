	<p class="bodyText">
	If a humanoid robot was to be successfully made and marketed worldwide, it would have a large impact on our human daily lives. We would utilise these robots to replace humans in all of the chores and jobs around the world. This would lessen the strain the human population would have to succumb to, leaving more time for humans to have more freedom. Of course in the first place, mass producing these robots to a commercial level would cost us materials and resources to create, affecting our Earth's composure and nature. This might have a big impact on accelerating global warming thus affecting our whole world. If passed as a commercial product, these robots would replace humans in almost all types of labour, including but not limited to; physical labour jobs, daily chores and war. Although sounding like a good idea, it also has its negatives such as, a large amount of overpopulation and the reduction of ambition in the population leading to laziness and unhealthy living habits to name a few.

	<h4  class="SubHeadText">How will they affect us?</h4>
	<p class="bodyText">
	For the average human being, having a personal humanoid robot could allow us more freedom to do things that we want to do. They could replace us in all of our daily chores such as house cleaning, cooking and gardening. They could also be used to educate kids and to drive us around. This would make the majority of our daily lives a redundant chores that is no longer needed by us to complete.This leaves us with more time but also will reduce our ambitions and motivation.
