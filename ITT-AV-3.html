	For me the effects of self-driving vehicles wouldn’t be that drastic compared to some, as I do not drive currently and take public transport, the idea of autonomous vehicles is like public transport. You get onto a vehicle and relax and let it take you where you want to go. The only main glaring difference is that there isn’t a driver. Having the ability of being driven in, in a car that you own and not having to look or concentrate on driving would be amazing. If everyone adapt and go onto the self-driving band wagon, I would allow for less traffic due to each car being driven on a fixed route where other selfdriving vehicles would also interact with your car allowing for seamless movement of traffic and the decrease of time taken going from one place to another. As for my parents, I think they would be late adopters to this technology, as they have driven their whole life, I wouldn’t expect them to one day hop into a driverless car and go somewhere, I would think they would like to have some safety measure in case of any emergency. However, overall, I believe that adopting driverless cars is for the better.
