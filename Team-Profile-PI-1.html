	Jared Makhoul s3601463:<br>
	Jared was born in Australia to parents of two different nationalities/cultures and doesn’t know much about his ancestry. Jared has already done studies in Associate Degree in Engineering as he initially had a goal of becoming an aerospace engineer but found IT to be more enjoyable in the end. He is very keen of extreme sports such as rally and even wants to become a professional driver one day. Other hobbies include snooker, which he plays competitively, and of course gaming. Gaming interest together with interest for IT started to appear in Jared when he got his Super Nintendo almost 15 years ago and has since evolved into interests for cryptography and programming.<br><br>
	Matthew Sesto s3783571:<br>
	Matthew is Australian born with family having mostly Croatian background. His mother tongue is English, and he can also speak partial Croatian. His free time activities mostly include sports, with soccer being the main one as he has been playing at soccer club called St Albans Saints for the past 3 years now and has even trialled for Melbourne City FC. He also enjoys playing computer games with his friends and has been passionate about IT since young age, leading him to currently studying IT at RMIT. Two main fields of study interest for Matthew are programming and statistics analysis. Programming keeps it interesting by challenging him and statistics comes in handy when dealing with sports data because as already mentioned Matthew really enjoys his sports. <br><br>
	Joshua Christopher Dyson Sykes s3780014:<br>
	Josh comes from city called Sheffield in South Yorkshire, England and he moved to Australia when he was 3 years old. Josh has both English and Australian citizenship but based on his roots he considers himself English. English is also his only spoken language as of right now however Josh has plans to study Spanish in coming semester which will then help him in finding jobs overseas as one of his passions is travelling. Like everyone in the group, the interest in IT appeared in Joshua’s mind when he was still very young. It all started with using Nintendo DS, then messing around with schools’ computers and finally grew into him trying to overcome every IT problem in his or his family’s day-to-day life.
