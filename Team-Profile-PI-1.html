	Josh<br><br>
	My name is Joshua Christopher Dyson Sykes (s3780014). I was born in England in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. My father is English and my mother is Australian. we migrated to Australia when I was 3 years old. I like to consider myself English based on my roots but I have both English & Australian citizenship. I finished year 12 last year and currently in my first year here at RMIT and loving it. I can only speak English, but next semester starting to learn Spanish. I love to travel and with the help of speaking another language will assist me in finding jobs overseas in new and exciting countries. My main interest in IT started around the time I got my first DS. That was the first experience of using an IT based system. And from then on, I got addicted to everything thing about IT. I gradually got interested in PCâ€™s in primary school where we had a computer lab full of desktops. I recall messing around with them trying to bypass the sites blocked (Games website), so that me and my friends could play them during computer lap sessions. Ever since then, I have loved using IT especially my own custom built pc.
